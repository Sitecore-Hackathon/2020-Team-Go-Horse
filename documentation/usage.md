# Usage Instructions

**Category:** Sitecore Marketplace Website

## Summary

This module was designed to tackle one of the biggest problems with the old Sitecore Marketplace Website: **Content Duplication.**

Module Authors usually add documentation to the Git Repository itself, so why should we re-input all content to the Marketplace, 
then keep it all update? 

Instead of copy/pasting, you will link modules directly with their respective Git Repositories. 
The GitHub WebAPI is then used to keep the Module Page in Sitecore always updated with the latest 
and greatest information from the Git Repository.

**2. Results** - Shows a list of modules, filtered by the search keyword input by the user

**3. Modules** - Bulk repository of Sitecore modules
