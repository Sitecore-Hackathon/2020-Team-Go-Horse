**Category:** Sitecore Marketplace Website

This module was designed to solve one of the biggest problems with the old Sitecore Marketplace Website: **Content Duplication.**

Module Authors usually add documentation to the Git Repository itself, so why should them duplicate all that content 
in Marketplace, and keep it manually updated? 

Instead of copy/pasting, this module allows to link modules directly with their respective Git Repositories. 
GitHub WebAPI is then used to keep the Module Page in Sitecore always updated with the latest 
and greatest information from the Git Repository.
