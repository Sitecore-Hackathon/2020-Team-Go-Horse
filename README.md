# Go-Horse Marketplace

**Category:** Sitecore Marketplace Website

This module was designed to tackle one of the biggest problems with the old Sitecore Marketplace Website: **Content Duplication**
Module Authors will usually add documentation pages to the Git Repository, so why should him re-input all content to the Marketplace?

Instead of copy/pasting, you can link your module directly with a Git Repository, and have the Module Page always updated 
with the latest and greatest information from Git.
